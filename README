If you'd like to make a donation, we are working on a system where
donations are taken on a per-feature-request basis via the website
with target amounts for each feature. In the meantime however you
may donate directly to the author via PayPal:

  PayPal: web20ita@gmail.com

Donations are certainly voluntary, but seriously, you donors are
complete legends and drive this project! :)
